        <p>BRIEF<br>
        Identify desirable, viable and feasible youth engagement approaches or services that Red Cross/ Red Crescent partners could apply for local youth action on working with nature to protect people. Develop a strategic plan of action for youth engagement in nature-positive solutions that outlines the vision and strategy, as well as a plan to execute it.</p>

        <p>SOLUTION<br>
        YEES is a product/service system that aims to educate young people in areas affected by climate disasters in a playful way, teaching them to implement nature-based solutions (NbS) to prevent and combat these disasters. It comprises a card game, an online platform, and physical hubs in the regions.</p>

        <p>PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION<br>
        During the research phase, I examined the youth engagement strategies of competitors and existing NbSs. During the execution phase, I developed the app prototype and finalised the roadmap.</p>

        <p>CARD GAME<br>
        In GoSolve, teams of players are presented with Problem and Solution cards, and the aim is to find the most suitable and viable solution for each problem.
        <br>Drawing from literature on gamification and activism, the game provides a springboard for young people to start working on a project, equipping them with the relevant knowledge. Thanks to its simple setup, this solution can easily be scaled up, making youth advocacy accessible and interactive on a global scale, regardless specific conditions.</p>

        <p>DIGITAL EXTENSION<br>
        Each card can be scanned to access its digital version. This allows you to navigate through the information displayed on it and access further explanations on the type of solution/disaster and its financial, social and environmental costs. You can also navigate to the other cards and explore the whole deck.
        <br>This digital extension also serves as a gateway to the online platform. For each Solution card, you can read about related projects and news that are directly linked to the full website.</p>

        <p>ONLINE PLATFORM<br>
        The website, powered by Red Cross, is an archive of NbS projects and news from all around the world. It provides accessible information in an environment where the target audience can share knowledge and be inspired by the work of others. The aim is to connect young people from similar backgrounds and empower them to take concrete local action.</p>
