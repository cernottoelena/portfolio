    <p>SOLUTION<br>
    The Adidas Omniverse strategy envisions expanding the brand into a holistic health and active lifestyle platform by 2050. Driven by trends in wellness and personalization, it outlines a roadmap from physical activity support to tech-enabled personal growth. Through gamified rewards, pop-ups, a digital app, and a subscription model offering services like fitness and meditation, Adidas will be able to redefine its role in a community-driven, digital wellness future.</p>

    <p>PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION<br>
    In the first phase, I used the Visual Foresight Method to research future trends. Then, I investigated possible business models and finally created the visualisation of the future artefact.</p>

    <p>VISUAL FORESIGHT MAP<br>
    The Visual Foresight Method, developed by Simonse (2024), is an approach to researching trends within communities. It aims to identify emerging patterns within a subculture of interest by collecting and analysing its visual artefacts. The Visual Foresight Method, developed by Simonse (2024), is an approach to researching trends within communities. It aims to identify emerging patterns within a subculture of interest by collecting and analysing its visual artefacts. The process unfolds in three stages: Visual Apprehension (of a NextGen subculture), Pattern Recognition & Interpretation, Visual Foresight Mapping.
    <br>The chosen subculture for this project was ‘Gorpcore’.</p>

    <p>FUTURE ARTIFACT<br>
    The project was highly speculative, with the main goal being to create a future scenario to inspire future Adidas research. To convey our vision, we created a manifesto that visually synthesises the values and features of the Omniverse, as well as a website that explains all of the services on offer.</p>
