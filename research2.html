    <p>ABSTRACT<br>
    This study investigates how different types of disgust affect consumer purchase intentions toward meat products, and how these effects vary based on the mental capacity of the animal. Using a 2 (disgust type: moral vs. primal, between-subjects) × 2 (animal capacity: high vs. low, within-subjects) mixed experimental design, participants (N = 44) evaluated pork (high-capacity) and salmon (low-capacity) products presented with either moral or primal disgust cues. Dependent variables included purchase intention, perceived disgust, and perceived empathy. Results showed that animal capacity significantly influenced all three dependent variables, with high-capacity animals eliciting more disgust and empathy, and lower purchase intentions. While moral disgust cues elicited stronger feelings of disgust than primal cues, they did not significantly affect purchase intentions.  These findings suggest that consumer behavior is more strongly shaped by perceptions of the animal than by the type of disgust framing. Practically, the study highlights the potential of targeted packaging interventions that evoke moral concern, particularly for high-capacity animals, as a strategy to promote more sustainable food choices and reduce meat consumption.</p>
