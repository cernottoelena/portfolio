    <p>ABSTRACT<br>
    The article explores the multifaceted role of the designer as a facilitator and mediator in addressing grand societal challenges. It emphasizes how designers can bridge the gap between community needs and governmental decision-makers, advocating for a community-led design approach that empowers local populations while acknowledging the necessity of government engagement for systemic change. It also critically examines the political implications of design, stressing the importance of justice-oriented and non-human-centered perspectives, and discusses the challenges of measuring qualitative impact in social design projects, ultimately envisioning a future where designers embrace humility and a playful aesthetic.</p>

    <p>LEARNING OBJECTIVES<br>

The outcome is an article analysing the work of a previously interviewed professional, exploring how their practice could be integrated with concepts derived from academic readings.</p>

    <p>THE KNOWLEDGE FRAMEWORK<br>
    The Knowledge Framework is a tool that collects, synthesises and visualises theories and concepts from academic literature on societal missions, making it easy to identify relationships between fields and perspectives. It also served as the basis for semi-structured interviews with experts in the field.</p>
